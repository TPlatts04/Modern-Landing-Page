      <h4>1. Do i need proof of residency when creating an account?</h4>
      <li class="ms-2 mt-3 item-1 fs-5">No, simply put, you do not need to provide us with a proof of residency, this is because we are not a trading firm and therefore do not need any documents to prove that you understand any risks. This is also because there are no risks when using our software.</li>

      <h4 class="mt-4">2. Why is there a maximum spending limit?</h4>
      <li class="ms-2 mt-3 item-2 fs-5">The reason we set a spending limit within the account based off of your subscription to us, is because we value our customers pride and also the way that they comfortably spend money from day to day, this software has high spending limits for even the average person as our target is more of the higher-bracket of earners within the world.</li>

      <h4 class="mt-4">3. Can we use your application offline?</h4>
      <li class="ms-2 mt-3 item-3 fs-5">Yes you are able to use our application offline, this means no wifi, no mobile data etc. This is because we provide the app to you through downloading data on your device which can be accessed offline. Now if you think that this is a bit odd, as why would we download data to your device, just think, every offline app, from games to fitness trackers does this, it's not just us.</li>

      <h4 class="mt-4">4. How secure is your database?</h4>
      <li class="ms-2 mt-3 item-4 fs-5">Now we know this isn't a question for everybody, but for people who want to know how secure their data is then here you go. We do NOT give out your data to any thrid party applications, what happens in the business, stays in the business. Our data is backed up on multiple servers and each one has their seperate firewall so there is a miniscule chance of an unauthorised port from accessing your data.</li>

      <h4 class="mt-4">5. Is there any further security to protect myself from people who access the same devices as me?</h4>
      <li class="ms-2 mt-3 item-5 fs-5">Yes there are. We have implemented multiple security pathways into our application, we have the basic email and password, but you will be forced to setup 2FA (2 Factor Authentication), then there will be further prompts which is completely up to you to decide if you want them added or not. These prompts range from a simple 6-digit passcode, to biometric recognition.</li>
